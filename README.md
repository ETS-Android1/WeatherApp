Weather App - Clone Samsung Wheather App
Hello Everyone! Khabi in touch!

Today I started building the Weather app.
I tried to completely make the same interface as the built-in Samsung application.
I wrote the main logic.
In the search, you type the desired city and click on the button with the magnifying glass icon. Calculations occur in a separate background thread. As a data site, I took the Openweathermap API.

Using json, I brought certain data into a readable form, namely the current temperature, description, maximum and minimum temperatures, feels like, and an icon corresponding to the temperature. Also in the android manifest added permission to the Internet.

At the moment, I have lost all interest in continuing to write this application, and therefore I canâ€™t bring myself to understand the functions of showing the weather every hour and for a week. Now I'm back to Kotlin. Maybe in the future I will finish this application.
